### EquusFirst
###### Be the Rider your Horse would choose!

Whether your goal is to hack safely, improve your riding, take part in fun rides
or compete in any discipline: I provide an enthusiastic, sympathetic and knowledgeable
approach.

I use simple methods to teach all levels of riders and horses, allowing you to develop
an understanding rather than simply be instructed. In doing so, my pupils grow in
confidence as they increase their own knowledge.
